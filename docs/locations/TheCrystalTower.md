## Lore

The Crystal Tower is said to have been built by old gods. As the last great works of the gods before they went to sleep.

You can climb to the hightest floor in the tower and it is said whoever reaches the hightest floor will be granted godhood.

You can also climb to the lowest level of the tower. It is said that on the lowest level of the tower there is a treasure behind anyone's comprehension.
